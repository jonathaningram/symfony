2.1.0
-----

### DoctrineBrige

 * added a default implementation of the ManagerRegistry
 * added a session storage for Doctrine DBAL

### AbstractDoctrineBundle

 * This bundle has been removed and the relevant code has been moved to the Doctrine bridge

### DoctrineBundle

 * added optional `group_by` property to `EntityType` that supports either a `PropertyPath` or a `\Closure` that is evaluated on the entity choices
 * The `em` option for the `UniqueEntity` constraint is now optional (and should probably not be used anymore).

### SecurityBundle

 * [BC BREAK] The custom factories for the firewall configuration are now
   registered during the build method of bundles instead of being registered
   by the end-user (you need to remove the 'factories' keys in your security
   configuration).

 * [BC BREAK] The Firewall listener is now registered after the Router one. It
   means that specific Firewall URLs (like /login_check and /logout must now
   have proper route defined in your routing configuration)

 * [BC BREAK] refactored the user provider configuration. The configuration
   changed for the chain provider and the memory provider:

   Before:

        security:
            providers:
                my_chain_provider:
                    providers: [my_memory_provider, my_doctrine_provider]
                my_memory_provider:
                    users:
                        toto: { password: foobar, roles: [ROLE_USER] }
                        foo: { password: bar, roles: [ROLE_USER, ROLE_ADMIN] }

   After:

        security:
            providers:
                my_chain_provider:
                    chain:
                        providers: [my_memory_provider, my_doctrine_provider]
                my_memory_provider:
                    memory:
                        users:
                            toto: { password: foobar, roles: [ROLE_USER] }
                            foo: { password: bar, roles: [ROLE_USER, ROLE_ADMIN] }

 * added a validator for the user password
 * added 'erase_credentials' as a configuration key (true by default)
 * added new events: `security.authentication.success` and `security.authentication.failure`
   fired on authentication success/failure, regardless of authentication method,
   events are defined in new event class: `Symfony\Component\Security\Core\AuthenticationEvents`.
