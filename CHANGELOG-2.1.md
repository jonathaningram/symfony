2.1.0

 * added a default implementation of the ManagerRegistry
 * added a session storage for Doctrine DBAL

### TwigBridge

 * added a csrf_token function
 * added a way to specify a default domain for a Twig template (via the 'trans_default_domain' tag)

### AbstractDoctrineBundle

 * This bundle has been removed and the relevant code has been moved to the Doctrine bridge

### DoctrineBundle

 * This bundle has been moved to the Doctrine organization
 * added optional `group_by` property to `EntityType` that supports either a `PropertyPath` or a `\Closure` that is evaluated on the entity choices
 * The `em` option for the `UniqueEntity` constraint is now optional (and should probably not be used anymore).

### SecurityBundle

 * [BC BREAK] The custom factories for the firewall configuration are now
   registered during the build method of bundles instead of being registered
   by the end-user (you need to remove the 'factories' keys in your security
   configuration).

 * [BC BREAK] The Firewall listener is now registered after the Router one. It
   means that specific Firewall URLs (like /login_check and /logout must now
   have proper route defined in your routing configuration)

 * [BC BREAK] refactored the user provider configuration. The configuration
   changed for the chain provider and the memory provider:

     Before:

     ``` yaml
     security:
         providers:
             my_chain_provider:
                 providers: [my_memory_provider, my_doctrine_provider]
             my_memory_provider:
                 users:
                     toto: { password: foobar, roles: [ROLE_USER] }
                     foo: { password: bar, roles: [ROLE_USER, ROLE_ADMIN] }
     ```

     After:

     ``` yaml
     security:
         providers:
             my_chain_provider:
                 chain:
                     providers: [my_memory_provider, my_doctrine_provider]
             my_memory_provider:
                 memory:
                     users:
                         toto: { password: foobar, roles: [ROLE_USER] }
                         foo: { password: bar, roles: [ROLE_USER, ROLE_ADMIN] }
     ```

 * [BC BREAK] Method `equals` was removed from `UserInterface` to its own new
   `EquatableInterface`, now user class can implement this interface to override
   the default implementation of users equality test.

 * added a validator for the user password
 * added 'erase_credentials' as a configuration key (true by default)
 * added new events: `security.authentication.success` and `security.authentication.failure`
   fired on authentication success/failure, regardless of authentication method,
   events are defined in new event class: `Symfony\Component\Security\Core\AuthenticationEvents`.

 * moved the data collector to the bridge
 * replaced MessageLogger class with the one from Swiftmailer 4.1.3

### TwigBundle

 * added the real template name when an error occurs in a Twig template

### ClassLoader

   and only contain letters, digits, underscores, hyphens and colons
 * [BC BREAK] changed default name of the prototype in the "collection" type
   from "$$name$$" to "__name__". No dollars are appended/prepended to custom
   names anymore.
 * [BC BREAK] improved ChoiceListInterface and all of its implementations
 * [BC BREAK] removed EntitiesToArrayTransformer and EntityToIdTransformer.
   The former has been replaced by CollectionToArrayTransformer in combination
   with EntityChoiceList, the latter is not required in the core anymore.

 * [BC BREAK] renamed

   * ArrayToBooleanChoicesTransformer to ChoicesToBooleanArrayTransformer
   * ScalarToBooleanChoicesTransformer to ChoiceToBooleanArrayTransformer
   * ArrayToChoicesTransformer to ChoicesToValuesTransformer
   * ScalarToChoiceTransformer to ChoiceToValueTransformer

   to be consistent with the naming in ChoiceListInterface.

 * [BC BREAK] removed FormUtil::toArrayKey() and FormUtil::toArrayKeys().
   They were merged into ChoiceList and have no public equivalent anymore.
